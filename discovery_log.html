    <button class="transition">Week 1 - Welcome to Web Foundations 1</button>
    <section class="panel">
    <p>In the first week, I was introduced to the web foundations course,
       being given a rundown on what our specification was for the year
       and a small insight of the type of things we would begin to learn.
       Our lecturer divided our total coursework into 2 sections. The first
       was a 1000 word limit literature review using APAv6 Referencing and
       Citations. The next coursework was to make a website from scratch
       combining both HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
     </section>
    <button class="transition">Week 2 - Information Security & Unit Prep</button>
    <section class="panel">
    <p>In the second week, We were introduced to different editors on a
      worksheet, The first task was to create a time plan for a week which
      in my own time I developed into a yearly timetable, not just for web
      foundations but also for my other subject areas, in order to fulfill
      the yearly advisory hours requirement. We also picked an editor for our
      HTML5 coursework, I found that Atom was the best for me as I could add
      packages and shortcuts which made programming more enjoyable and productive.</p>
    </section>
    <button class="transition">Week 3 - Web Security</button>
    <section class="panel">
    <p>In the third week, I was introduced to the inside of the web and the
       security of the web, the head of computing, Dr. Nick Savage, presented
       this interesting lecture in which we were shown the ways in which we
       are vulnerable to data leakage which later I found very helpful when I
       begin to write my Literature Review. I learned that having a simple
       password or even a common password just makes being hacked even easier.
       Even the post we receive is a vulnerability.</p>
     </section>
     <button class="transition">Week 4 - Reviewing Literature</button>
     <section class="panel">
    <p>In the fourth week, we were introduced in depth with our first coursework
       which was the literature review. The main topics were ‘mitigating corporate
       information exposure on the web’. I learned that the university library has
       a keyword search and so does google scholar which would help me find academic
       journals in the topic area, Rather than using secondary or uncredited
       information. Our lecturers guided to these tools to begin our research and
       make a plan for our 1000 word essay.</p>
     </section>
     <button class="transition">Week 5 - Academic Writing</button>
     <section class="panel">
    <p>In the fifth week, we were given a lecture and practical on Academic Writing,
      which showed us how we can reference and cite our work in a professional manner
      using the required APAv6 referencing method. I found this very helpful as from
      this and the previous week I found that I now have the tools I need to achieve
      accredited and concise information regarding my topic and have a template for
      citations and referencing which I am doing as I go along with my literature review.</p>
    </section>
    <button class="transition">Week 6 - Introduction to Markup</button>
    <section class="panel">
    <p>In the sixth week, we were introduced to Markup languages & HTML for the first
       time, In this week we were given the science behind or even the history of HTML
       and markup languages, we let our lecturers know if we have any previous HTML
       experience and for those like myself who have never used HTML, we were introduced
       to the absolute background of HTML and markup languages and why we use it on the
       web. I acknowledged that HTML has been made to make the coding side of things on
       the webs, the design side was CSS3.</p>
       </section>
       <button class="transition">Week 7 - Literature Review Coursework</button>
       <section class="panel">
    <p>In the seventh week, it was a reading week so we had no lectures and practicals,
       however this was also the week in which our Literature Review, the first coursework
       was due, this was our first submission so we had a chance to improve further of the
       feedback given by our lecturers, this was a good opportunity for me to proofread all
       my work. One thing I made sure of was having no plagiarism, Everything I wrote myself
       and researched myself. Personally, I really enjoyed reading on an Author Imad M. Ibadi
       as his views on the exposure included a solution which was the answer to the question
       suggesting everything is tracked and recorded in a log which should only be handled by
       higher authority in the business to track and observe everything going on in the
       business and providing essential training where necessary to prevent all data exposure
       on the web.</p>
       </section>
    <button class="transition">Week 8 - Separating Form and Content</button>
    <section class="panel">
    <p>In the eighth week, we solely began to focus on pure HTML and CSS and this is all that's
       left, we learned that HTML is only used for content and provides all the information
       such as the text and the headings etc. CSS was now introduced to us and we found that CSS
       is actually what we will be using and is commonly used when creating the Form or Design in
       websites which gives us that appealing look. I looked at an example of a newspaper web page
       such as BBC, which gave me a clear insight when I used Google Chrome, I right clicked and
       pressed inspect element, it showed me clearly where HTML was used and where CSS was used,
       and you can clearly differentiate the two. I found all the HTML was all the text and important
       information on the website and the rest of it was the design which was in CSS.</p>
       </section>
    <button class="transition">Week 9 - Productivity and Efficiency: Editors</button>
    <section class="panel">
    <p>In the ninth week, Our lecturers directed us to the best editor in their preference, It was
       Atom which is what I was already using. They explained the benefit of it over other editors
       and also told us a few packages, which I myself didn't know about that could make our
       programming easier, they also mentioned some shortcuts such as tab when u right the beginning
       of a function in HTML. I tried it when beginning my coding practice for HTML5 and CSS3. I saw
       that when I wrote HTML and pressed tab it would give me all the base code I needed to write
       HTML5 code which is extremely helpful. I also learned to use WinSCP to connect my website to
       an IP address using my virtual machine and display what I've coded in Atom.</p>
       </section>
    <button class="transition">Week 10 - Design</button>
    <section class="panel">
    <p>In the tenth week, we began to focus much more on CSS. looking at what design techniques we
       can use when making our own websites for our second and final coursework. In our practical
       session we used a bunch of words and categorized them in sections for a hotel online website,
       the idea was to categorize certain topics in a subheading on the website. From this I learned
       that even over the smallest options my group and I differed in thoughts, so you have to look
       at the audience when making your website rather than your preference and getting constant
       feedback on every change is essential and key.</p>
       </section>
    <button class="transition">Week 11 - Using Images</button>
    <section class="panel">
    <p>In the eleventh week, we had a whole lecture and practical on using images and the different
       ways we could do so. Our lecturer showed us all the possible things you need to look at,
       position of the image, tags when you hover above the image, resizing the image, fixing image
       size if it comes out wrong and also my personal favourite, changing the image to a smaller each
       time you have the page reach a certain size in measurement of pixels. In my practical, I asked
       Dr. Rich Boakes how to adjust the image size if the screen size was reduced. He taught me in CSS
       where all such editing occurs if I, under the img tag set the max-width; 100%. It would change
       the size of the screen if it got smaller and if I made the screen bigger it would only get as big
       as its original size and not bigger to prevent it becoming pixelated.</p>

    <button class="transition">Week 12 - Christmas Lecture</button>
    <section class="panel">
    <p>In the twelfth and final lecture of the first semester, we had more of a fun and interactive lecture
       without lecturers in which we made an advent calendar for Christmas using images, animations and
       sounds. The idea of this lecture was to have a little bit of fun with HTML5 and CSS3 but also
       introduce the sort of things we would be doing in the second year if we chose web-script programming.
       I find HTML and CSS very interesting and one of the more enjoyable and hands-on practical subjects
       to do so I definitely am considering it as a high priority for my second year.</p>
       </section>
    <button class="transition">Week 13 - Website Marking Scheme</button>
    <section class="panel">
    <p>In the thirteenth week and the first week of the second semester, we were introduced officially with
       the second course in depth with all the things we can and cannot use. The Peer Review Marking Guide
       was also released which shows us what we have to do in order to achieve maximum marks. In this week
       I began my work on my website and have completed the heading and categories to other pages in which
       ie also formatted my literature review into it so that it looks clean and professional. I have chosen
       to be simplistic with my design as instructed by my Lecturers and keep proof-reading my lecture notes
       to make sure I use only HTML5 and CSS3 and nothing older and also avoid certain tags such as font and
       br (break). I will be using the w3 validator constantly to make sure all my work is correct. Also, I
       installed the HTML Linter Package which tells me if and where I have errors.</p>
       </section>
    <button class="transition">Week 14 - Addressing the Web</button>
    <section class="panel">
    <p>In the fourteenth week, we were introduced to addressing in the web where the lecturer explained bit
       by bit where and what every part of the web address means. To begin with, we looked at IP Addresses
       and found out that binary addresses are converted into the web addresses that we see. From there,
       depending on the page you are on, you will find the name of the domain and after the backslash you
       will find all the code such as the video which would be in example, video.php. In my own time i
       studied this a bit further on different pages of the same website. I could find certain parts that
       were included in that webpage, just by looking at the address.</p>
       </section>
    <button class="transition">Week 15 - Usability</button>
    <section class="panel">
    <p>In the fifteenth week, we looked at usability of the website, within this lecture and practical we
      looked at what is appropriate and what is not. You can find certain web pages which are unhelpful,
      such as a form on a website with no submit button. Personally that and made me think what i need to
      do in my own website which makes the usability effectively and correctly accordingly to the page on
      my website for  my coursework. This proved to be an easy task for me as there was not much to do on
      my website apart from view. My job was to insure that everything is usable to every user.</p>
    <button class="transition">Week 16 - Accessibility</button>
    </section>
    <section class="panel">
    <p>In the sixteenth week, we discussed accessibility of a website for those who are less able than the
      average human. To compliment this website we had a practical task where we had ice cream sticks and
      latex disposable gloves. We were assigned with tasks to do using the gloves and also glassed that
      meant that your vision was impaired. This taught me that i should go for a very simple and user
      friendly design and simplistic use over the over complex features for my coursework and you have to
      take into account the users that will be using the website.</p>
    </section>
    <button class="transition">Week 17 - Scalable Graphics on the Web</button>
    <section class="panel">
    <p>In the seventeenth week, we looked at the SVG programming language in both lectures and practicals.
      With this we can create our own images which can be exported and saved in the format of picture types
      such as .jpeg and .png. In our practical, we were challenged by our lecturer, Dr. Rich Boakes, to a
      drawing challenge of the university logo and beat him to it. I lost to him as he has experience.
      However, i did learn a lot about how to draw the university logo just using shapes. One thing i did
      to practice, was use graph paper to draw it out with its size in cm, to work out how to make it using
      maths and i found that to be very help.</p>
      </section>
    <button class="transition">Week 18 - Website Submission & Basic Scripting</button>
    <section class="panel">
    <p>In the eighteenth week, we looked at javascript. We looked at making stickmans and making them move
      around. The good thing i found about this is that i was able to get an insight of the second year,
      the one thing i found great about this is the animated version on the web that is interactive. We
      were also shown how to make a game using stickmans with diemans. I personally used this when looking
      into creating a slider for a website, so when you click a button it will scroll down
      automatically.</p>
