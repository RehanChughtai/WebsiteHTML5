    <h2>Mitigating Coperate information exposure on the web</h2>
    <p>Data leakage is defined as the procedure of which data is
       unintentionally transferred from an individual visiting a third party website.
       (Bertrand Bathelot, December 2012, Page 1). Data leakage is split into two
       categories(Amin Babiker, April 2015, Page 23); Intentional and Unintentional
       Data leakage. Unintentional Data Leakage occurs due to miscalculations and mistakes
       by employees, more often than usual this is occurring in new employees during
       training phases. However, Intentional Data leakage tends to occur when a company
       targets an individual who works there. This may lead to phishing data leakage.
       (Sharifa Hassan, April 2015, Pages 23-25)</p>
    <p>Unintentional Internal Data Leakage occurs mainly through overlooked or poor business
       processing when working as an employee. When this occurs a business must find a
       solution by re-engineering their organizational system. Taking the role of a company
       employee working in the database sector which handles all the sensitive and core data,
       having an employee with poor programming skills in languages such as SQL (Structured
       Query Language) could lead to an injection attack meaning through accidental coding,
       a company will be attacked by the means as a result of it being stolen. As an
       essentiality for every business in every field, it is a mandatory requirement to obtain
       a strong and secure anti-virus for protection against malware. Simple malware can spread
       and obtain/corrupt sensitive information in Businesses.(Peter Gordon, October 2007,
       Pages 8-16) </p>
    <p>Alongside this, Malicious Web Pages, more well known as pop up ads, attempting to access
      such sites as an employee on your workspace may be allowing Hackers of some sort to
      remotely access your computer and information which would then lead to obtaining sensitive
      data with unauthorized access not only putting the employing in trouble, but also putting
      the business at risk.(D.Geer, Sep 2007, Pages 8-25) As a solution to such issues, it is
      essential that a business examines the faults which are causing such problems to occur and
      from this reprogram their sector, making important decisions that are best for the business,
      i.e; making certain individuals who lack key skills redundant and hiring more professional
      and trustworthy employees, in regards to this, It would be key to constantly retrain their
      employees and keep up to date with all the essential skills. (Peter Gordon, October 2007,
      Pages 5-8)</p>
    <p>Intentional Leakage tends to arise from most commonly, Dishonest employees, who have the
       rights to access cooperate and critical information from the internal aspects of the
       business and use this to their advantages when they leak internal data. Such employees
       know when and where to collect certain sensitive data. A solution is proposed which states
       that the organization binds sensitive data to devices which do not allow unnecessary access.
       You must provide the reason for which you want to access the information. (Muntaha Alawneh,
       Imad M.Abbadi, Sec 2008, Pages 238-253)</p>
    <p>Intentional Leakage occurs as a consequence of information sharing between certain
       individuals within the same organization and work field, In many circumstances, this has
       led to the increase in file transfer through spying and undercover work as a result to
       gain a financial reward.(Muntaha Alawneh, Imad M.Abbadi, Aug 2008, Article No.38). As a
       solution to such a point of issue, a solution was recommended in which we used location-based
       tracking devices in order to not only allow access to sensitive data to certain personal but
       also keeping track of where and when certain information has been accessed and for what
       purpose. (Imad M.Abbadi, Sep 2007, Pages 288-295)</p>
    <p>In May 2016, the UK Government stated in a report that ⅔ of Large Business had been attacked
      by a cyber-attack. Looking at the following statistics, the government has invested approximately
      £2 Billion into a new cyber security strategy which will proceed in February 2017 as the National
      Cyber Security Centre. (Joe Kim, July 2017, Pages 8-11). Fundamentally, within businesses,
      Digital technology has changed over the past few years, However, cyber-security has failed to
      keep up, some aspects of responsibility for this comes from C-suite. By failing to face this,
      businesses face too much risk. Cyber Security needs to be given much more attention and needs to
      be updated as a mandatory priority for every C-suite. (Adam Boone, February 2017,
      Pages 13-15)</p>
    <p>Certain methods have been appraised for mitigating corporate information exposure on the web
      against attacks. Such that we incorporate unforeseeable information using various techniques
      such as reduction of signal to noise ratio, clock stopping, an introduction of certain features
      within a business environment such as Fingerprints to gain access and alongside this recruiting
      reputable well-trained employees who are taught before entering the workspace with the policies
      and laws around their work. For the more regular and general employees, the concept of having a
      special desktop setup which increases the cyber security on the system and reduces further risks
      of leakage of data systems.(Paul.C Kocher, December 2001)</p>
    <p>Alongside such mitigation, an essentiality is in need of Policies, as a corporate business,
       a security measure must be put in place to establish a data protection. This should include,
       Data Classification as the biggest priority must be put in place to allow accurate
       classification of data in order to minimize redundant data transfer; A risk matrix for data
       should be implemented such as financial records to propose a safer and stronger security
       measure to protect highly sensitive data; Ownership standards is key to specify who within
       the business, owns the data; Secure database models built by programmers to prevent a
       security breach and eliminate flaws as such; Data exchange regarding which data can be
       accessed both internally and externally; Confidentiality Agreements should be signed by
       every employee to ensure safety of data and if this agreement is breached, then the
       business is allowed to prosecute the employee; User training is essential as a part of
       employment to ensure that employees are aware of their responsibilities in regards to
       their access to certain confidential and sensitive information and internet resources
       and Finally, Secure Data Destruction which is a countless amount of actions that can
       be taken in order to destroy physical and internal data such as using high-security
       shredders. (R.Bayan, Aug 2007, Pages 53-57)</p>
