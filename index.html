          Data leakage is defined as the procedure of which data
          is unintentionally transferred from an individual visiting a third party
          website.(Bertrand Bathelot, December 2012, Page 1). Data leakage is split
          into two categories(Amin Babiker, April 2015, Page 23); Intentional and
          Unintentional Data leakage. Unintentional Data Leakage occurs due to
          miscalculations and mistakes by employees, more often than usual this is
          occurring in new employees during training phases. However, Intentional Data
          leakage tends to occur when a company targets an individual who works there.
          This may lead to phishing data leakage.(Sharifa Hassan, April 2015, Pages 23-25)

        Week 1: In the first week, I was introduced to the web foundations course, being given
        a rundown on what our specification was for the year and a small insight of the
        type of things we would begin to learn. Our lecturer divided our total coursework
        into 2 sections. The first was a 1000 word limit literature review using APAv6
        Referencing and Citations. The next coursework was to make a website from scratch
        combining both HTML5 and CSS3.
